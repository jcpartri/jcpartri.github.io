> &#128214; Leviticus 19:11 - You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.

## Introduction

Installing Python on your system is pretty easy. You just have to consider a few things first.

You need to make sure that you have the right to install any piece of software on the system you intend to install it on. If a person belongs to Christ then they are called to follow Christ and His example in every area of life. (John 12:26)

- Do you have the proper system resources? Memory/Processor/etc...
- Is this your own personal system or is it someone else's?
- Do you have full privileges or are you supervised by another person or group?
- Do you have administrative privileges or just basic user privileges?

If you do not have the proper system resources: **Find a computer that does.**

If the system is not your system: **get the needed permissions from the owner.**

If you are supervised by another person or group: **get the needed permissions from your supervisor/s.**

If you do not have administrative priviledges: **seek the correct course of action from your administrator.**

_This is how we wish to apply what Leviticus 19:11 teaches in this lesson._

## Downloading and Installing Python

> For this text you will need: **Python 3.10.x OR Higher** The most recent version of Python is preferable.

**Step 1**: Go to [Python.org/Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Step 2**: Download the latest version onto your system.

**Step 3**: Once the installer file is downloaded, double click on the installer. An installation _wizard_ should appear.

> **Note:** On Windows systems you will want to make sure you choose the following.
> 
> Make sure that both the 
> 
> [ x ] Use admin privileges when installing py.exe
> 
> [ x ] Add python.exe to PATH
> 
> are **BOTH** checked.

**Step 4:** Click on `Install` Now and let the installation process continue. That's it! You now have Python

## Verifying the Installation

Now do the following tasks.

### Windows ![win_logo](../images/win11_logo.png)

---

If you are using a Windows  system then in the search bar, type in `cmd`.

![type cmd](../images/chp_0_lesson_1_type_cmd.png)

Then `Command Prompt` should appear in your menu. Choose `Run as Administrator`.

![run as administrator](../images/chp_0_lesson_1_choose_command_prompt.png)

Type in `py --version` in the command prompt. You hopefully should get something that looks like the following. (maybe not exactly like it, but that is ok.)

```
$ py --version
Python 3.12.X
```

If you see an error message then something went wrong with your installation. You will need to consult an outside source to get the installation complete. It also could be that your current system is not up to date for the version of Python that you downloaded.

### MacOS ![Apple logo](../images/apple_logo.png)

---

Open the `Terminal` app. The easiest way to do this on a Macintosh computer is to press `Command + Space` on your keyboard. This will open up Spotlight Search.

> Note: The Spotlight Search icon is also located on the top menu bar of your screen in the right most part of your screen. It looks like a spyglass.

Type in `Terminal` and select from the options.

In the terminal window type in: `python3 --version`

You should see something like the following.

```
python3 --version
Python 3.12.x
```

If you see an error message then something went wrong with your installation. You will need to consult an outside source to get the installation complete. It also could be that your current system is not up to date for the version of Python that you downloaded.

### Linux ![my tux](../images/my_tux.gif)

> Underlying Assumption: You are using a Debian based system like Ubuntu or Linux Mint.

Type: `CTRL + ALT + T` to open a terminal window. Then type: `python3 --version` to verify the installation.

If you see an error message then something went wrong with your installation. You will need to consult an outside source to get the installation complete. It also could be that your current system is not up to date for the version of Python that you downloaded.

## Challenge

The `AP Computer Science` course uses Java as the primary programming language. If you have enough system resources on your computer and all the correct permissions, then do some research online to see how to download and install the Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit)

## Summary

In this lesson we have learned how to download, install, and verify that Python is installed on our system. At the beginning of this lesson there is also a focus on having the proper system resources and permissions before installing a piece of software. Doing everything with integrity and honesty is pleasing to the Lord. He is worth it.
