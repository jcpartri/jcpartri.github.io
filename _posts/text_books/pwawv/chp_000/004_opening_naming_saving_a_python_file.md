# Open, Name, Save a Python File

## Introduction

> &#128214; Jeremiah 31:33 - For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

In this lesson we are going to discuss opening and saving our Python files in IDLE and VS Code. While the verse above declares what God will do and has done in this age, the new covenant age, it parallels with this lesson in the following way.

We write data to files and save data in files. God writes His ways and precepts on the hearts of His people. Unlke files, what He writes will last forever!

## IDLE

**Step 1:** Open IDLE.

**Step 2:** Choose `File` &rarr; `New File`

_A keyboard shortcut for creating a new file is also:_ `CTRL` + `N` (Windows/Linux), &#8984; + `N` (Macintosh)

**Step 3:** The Editor Window should appear. In this window is where you type your Python scripts/programs.

**Step 4:** To save the file, choose `File` &rarr; `Save As`

_The keyboard shortcut in Windows is:_ `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `S`, on Macintosh &#8984; + `SHIFT` + `S`

**Step 5:** The `Save As` Dialog Window should appear. Name your file in the `File Name` field below. 

**IMPORTANT: All Python files must end with the .py extension.**

## VS Code

**Step 1:** Select `File` &rarr; `New File`

_Short cut key for_ Windows/Linux `CTRL` + `N`, on Macintosh &#8984; + `N`

![VS Code New File](../images/vs-code-win-new-file.png)

**Step 2:** A drop down menu will appear. VS Code will ask you what type of file to create. Choose `Python File`.

The tab should now have a Python icon on it once you have chosen the file type.

**Step 4:** The `Save As` Dialog Window will appear. Name the file in the `File Name` field below.

**IMPORTANT: All Python files must end with the .py extension!**

**Step 5:** Click on the `Save` button. You are done! :smiley:

## Summary

- In this lesson we have learned how to create and save a python file in both IDLE and VS Code.
- All Python files must end with the `*.py` extension.
