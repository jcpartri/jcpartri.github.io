## Introduction

> &#128214; 2 Timothy 2:7 - Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. 

_Think over what I say_... Paul admonishes young Timothy to think, think deeply, think hard, think a lot. Timothy, take what I say with seriousness and gravity and it comes with a wonderful promise. God will not be silent Timothy. He will _give you understanding in everything._ What a great approach to have for anything in life! 

Let us who claim Christ Jesus as our own, take His word into our hearts with trust and faith, with all gravity, and then seek His face to grant us understanding. And He will do it because all the promises of God are yes and amen in Christ Jesus. (2 Corinthians 1:20)

In this lesson we are going to learn about the Python programming language. Lets ask our Lord in our hearts to grant us all wisdom and understanding as we begin our learning.

## So.. Python. What is it?

Python is a programming language developed originally by Guido van Rossum at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in the Netherlands. The language was coined "Python" after a famous British comedy group.

Python has become the favorite _first_ computer language in the academic community. Some of the reasons why this is the case are:

- It is a high level language structured more like modern English
- It has a wide range of applications
- It has cross platform compatibility
- And a whole lot more!

Python is used in many of the following industries.

- Web Development
- Data Science and Analytics
- AI
- Finance
- Scientific Computing
- Education 
- And a whole lot more!

## Why Did He Name It Python?

The naming mechanism for computer technologies is haphazard at best and complete chaos at the other end. Languages like C and C++ are easy. At Bell labs, Dennis M. Ritchie designed C to be a minimalist language. It was based upon CPL (Combined Programming Language) which had been compressed into what is known as B, created by Ken Thompson a collegue of Ritchie.

Then along came C++ which introduced object oriented programming (more on that later) developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, also at Bell Labs. For now, let's just say that C++ had more bells and whistles and was originally known in the community as "C with classes". Again, more on "classes" much later.

Then the late 70's came and then the 80's, 90's and early 2000's happened and technologies exploded. Along came, Pascal, Java, Javascript (not related to Java), Node, Golang ("Go"), PHP, Ruby, Scratch, SQL, Visual Basic, ... and so on and so forth. All these names and what do they stand for? Well, here are the facts. Programmers are weird. It really is as simple as that. They come up with a name. No one really asks why, and if the technology is a success, the name sticks.

I am glad we are ending here because our names, unlike names in technology, **DO** matter. In fact, names matter so much to the Lord that at the end of days when all His church is with Him, He will give to every believer a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it. (Revelation 2:17)

A name means a lot. God's name is the most Holy name of all. It describes what He is in His being. "I AM that I AM" (Exodus 3:14) This is what He tells Moses from the burning bush. My being is essential. So essential that I am the reason all things exist. Not the other way around. I am the eternally self existant One. This is why the question "_Who created God?_" makes no sense. God needs nothing to exist. Existence proceeds from Him.

To have the creator of all things, who has loved us through the Lord Jesus Christ, name us Himself shows just how personal and close He calls His people to Himself. Think on that. Love that. Live like that every day! :smiley:

## Summary

In this lesson we have discussed what Python is and where and why it is used. We discussed technology names and the haphazard way they come about. We finished this lesson focusing on the importance of names and a promise in scripture that God will fulfill in His own good timing.
