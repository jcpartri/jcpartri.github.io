Welcome to _"Python With A Worldview!"_ This text has been developed to instruct, edify, and prepare students in their goals for a career in Computer Science. In this book we will learn the Python programming language and in the process, learn how to solve problems with Python.

Our worldview is from a biblical perspective that centers on the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ. Students are given computer science content and instruction that encourages them to think about God and His revelation of Himself in the face of Christ, while they are doing computer science!
